# Traveling

## Things to note when traveling in Tokyo on February (end of winter)

1. It is still cold.
    - Especially if you're used to warmer climate, e.g. Singapore, Malaysia.
    - The average temperature is below 10 degree Celsius - which is bearable, until the wind blows
    - It may rain a little, check the weather forecast.
1. Wear a comfortable/light jacket with heat-tech clothes.
    - You don't need many layers of clothes, because it will be hot in-door (train/bus/taxi/mall) and it's inconvenient to de-layer (and you don't want to get sweaty).
    - The combination of Uniqlo [HeatTech inner shirt, pants](http://www.uniqlo.com/sg/store/men/collections/heattech.html), any comfortable t-shirt, long jeans, and a [ultra light down jacket](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/outerwear-and-blazers/ultra-light-down) is perfect.
    - Get a jacket with hood, that can substitute an umbrella.
    - You can prepare 2-3 sets of clothes and buy the rest in Japan's Uniqlo stores. They're available at lots of places and it's cheaper with end-season sales.
1. Just wash your clothes in coin laundries.
    - It should be available in most apartments, especially if you're using AirBnB.
1. Buy and use stick-on heat packs.
    - They're quite cheap and available in most of the pharmacies.
    - You can stick a piece on to your feet, waist or any areas that you're vulnerable to cold.
1. Buy and use lipgloss.
    - It'll be okay without a lipgloss on the first 2 days, but you'll start feeling miserable after that.
