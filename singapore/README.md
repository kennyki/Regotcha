## Foreign employees must declare and pay GST for all goods brought into the country

I once was intercepted by the immigration officer when carrying a memory foam pillow through the custom. Without much clue of what's happening and filling in some forms later, I was brought to the tax counter to make addition payment for GST.

::: tip
According to the Custom's [statement](http://www.customs.gov.sg/individuals/going-through-customs/arrival/duty-free-concession-and-gst-relief):
> Holders of a work permit, employment pass, student pass, dependent pass or long-term pass issued by the Singapore Government and crew members are not eligible for GST relief.
