## Nice-to-have items for infant

These are not essentials but absolutely time and energy savers if you can afford them:

1. Disposable high-absorbent diapers
    - This is a no-brainer unless one of the parents are not working, or you have in-house helpers to help washing reusable cloth diapers. Sure, cloth diapers are cute and can save money in the long run, but it's really hard to maintain: you need tens of them, quick change when baby peed/pooped, non-stop washing.
    - It's a good choice if your time can be better spent bonding with your baby and your earnings outweigh the cost.
1. Foldable light-weight stroller
    - Having used an older heavier (10kg) foldable stroller and switched to a much lighter and smaller one ([Joie pact](https://uk.joiebaby.com/product/pact/)), it does make a huge difference.
1. Nursing pillow
    - If the mother does breastfeed, this will definitely relief her from extreme sore waist.
1. Electric milk pump
    - It can never beat your baby to be the best milk pump, but it will help in stocking up milks.
1. Electric sterilizer
    - It's just much convenient than boiling and sterilize bottles by hands.
1. Indoor clothes dryer
    - Need quick turnover time for baby clothes or daily bedsheets for infant care? There are some really affordable and small sized dryers from China.
