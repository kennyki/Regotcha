## Adding vertical divider

It's quite easy to do with the [border](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/borders/) and [spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/) utility classes:

```html
<div>
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Likes: 99</span>
  <span class="border mx-2"></span>
  <span>Comments: 11</span>
  <span class="border mx-2"></span>
  <span>Shares: 10</span>
</div>
```
