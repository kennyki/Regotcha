# Regotcha

```
Recounting "gotcha!" moments
```

I'm Kenny, a front-end web developer at [RingMD](https://ring.md)

This is a place for me to keep track of [gotcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_%28programming%29) - like how I shouldn't use base64 string to store and render images in a [Hybrid Mobile App](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-hybrid-mobile-app).

Where I spent some unnecessary time to find the exact reason of bad performance with a really simple CRUD app, no one else should need to do it again and I need to be reminded of it.
