Recounting "gotcha!" moments
```

This is a list of [gotcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotcha_%28programming%29) - for example, don't use base64 string to store and render images in a [Hybrid Mobile App](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-hybrid-mobile-app).

While someone has spent the time to figure out something, i.e. finding the exact reason of bad performance with a really simple CRUD app, *no one else should do it again*. It also serve as a good reminder because we can be forgetful at times.
